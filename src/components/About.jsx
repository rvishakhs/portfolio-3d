                Hi there! My name is Visakh, and I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for web development. Over the
                years, I have honed my skills in various technologies such as Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose,
                React.js, Next.js, and Express.js, to name a few. Through my experience working on a few freelancing
                projects, I have gained valuable insight into the world of web development, and I'm constantly learning new
                things to improve my craft. I have a keen eye for detail, and I'm always striving to deliver high-quality
                work that meets the needs of my clients. As a self-taught developer, I believe in the power of perseverance
                and hard work. Learning new technologies can be challenging, but with the right mindset and dedication, I
                believe anything is possible. I am passionate about what I do, and I'm always looking for new opportunities
                to expand my knowledge and grow as a developer.
